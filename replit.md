The system features a modern React frontend with real-time chat capabilities, document upload/analysis, and agent management functionality. It's built as a full-stack TypeScript application optimized for mobile-first usage.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with session-based authentication
- **File Processing**: Multer for file uploads with support for DOC/PPT/TXT files
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for chat responses and document analysis

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session store for authentication
- **Schema**: Comprehensive relational schema supporting users, agents, conversations, messages, and documents

## Key Components

### Agent System
- **Categories**: School (학교), Professor (교수), Function (기능), Department (학과)
- **Features**: Custom icons, background colors, activation status
- **Management**: Administrative interface for agent creation and configuration
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and performance tracking

### Chat Interface
- **Real-time Messaging**: Conversation-based chat with message history
